    <h1>Experiment 013 - Genetic Overload</h1>
    <p>Date: August 4th, 2009</p>
    <p>
        The goal of Experiment 013 was to push the boundaries of cellular regeneration by introducing foreign DNA into human subjects. 
        What began as an attempt to enhance healing and recovery capabilities soon spiraled out of control. 
        The subject, injected with a highly unstable genetic compound, began experiencing rapid mutations within 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mutations first appeared harmless: enhanced muscle mass, heightened senses, faster reflexes. 
        But by day three, the changes became horrifying. The subject's skin began splitting open, revealing new layers of bone and tissue growing beneath, 
        each more grotesque than the last.
    </p>
    <p>
        By day seven, the subject was unrecognizableâ€”an amalgamation of twisted flesh and bone, constantly mutating. 
        Attempts to terminate the experiment failed as the subject became immune to all forms of lethal intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
        Last recorded sighting: The subject escaped containment on day 10. Its current whereabouts remain unknown.
