        <h1>Journal Entry: Experiment 007</h1>
        <h2 class="glow">Project: Reptilian Cold-Blooded Human</h2>

        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To infuse human biology with reptilian traits, enabling survival in extreme environments by altering thermoregulation and increasing predatory instincts.</p>

        <p>In 2006, Experiment 007 was initiated with bold ambition. By introducing reptilian DNA into the human genome, I sought to create a being that could survive in the harshest climates—deserts, frozen wastelands, places where human physiology would fail. Cold-blooded resilience was the key.</p>

        <p>The subject, initially healthy, began showing promising signs. His skin thickened, taking on a scaly texture. His body temperature dropped, yet he exhibited no signs of distress, as if the freezing lab conditions were of no consequence. The transformation was progressing beautifully... until it wasn’t.</p>

        <p>Within days, the subject’s ability to regulate body heat had vanished completely. His body no longer responded to the room temperature, and he began to crave extreme environments. We moved him to a heated chamber, but it only made things worse. His skin cracked and blistered in response, yet when placed in a freezing environment, his body stiffened to the point of paralysis.</p>

        <p>But that was only the beginning of the nightmare.</p>

        <p class="warning">The real horror began when the subject’s mind began to unravel. His eyes grew cold, lifeless, and his behavior shifted into something more animalistic. He stopped responding to human communication, retreating into corners, hissing when approached. Then came the hunger. Not a human hunger for food, but a predatory need to hunt.</p>

        <p>The subject lashed out violently, attacking one of the researchers with savage strength. We managed to sedate him, but the damage was done. His teeth had sharpened, his nails had elongated into claws, and he had tasted blood. The instinct to kill had awakened within him.</p>

        <p>After the attack, containment became impossible. The subject had fully embraced his reptilian nature, no longer capable of rational thought, driven purely by the cold-blooded survival instincts of a predator. He became more dangerous with each passing hour, his body constantly seeking heat, only to lash out in pain and anger as it failed to adapt.</p>

        <p class="warning">The experiment was a catastrophic failure. The subject is no longer human but a beast—cold, calculating, and deadly. We attempted to terminate the project, but he escaped, disappearing into the darkness of the facility. Now, he hunts, a predator created by my own hand, lurking in the shadows, waiting for the next moment to strike.</p>
        
        <p>The lesson is clear: human and reptile were never meant to coexist. The experiment gave rise to something monstrous, and there may be no way to stop it.</p>
