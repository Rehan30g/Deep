        <h1>Journal Entry: Experiment 004</h1>
        <h2 class="glow">Project: Aquatic Transformation</h2>

        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To merge human and shark DNA to create a being capable of thriving in the ocean depths, with the ability to live and breathe underwater indefinitely.</p>

        <p>In 2003, Experiment 004 began with great aspirations. The thought of human beings conquering the ocean, unshackled by the need for oxygen tanks or submarines, was tantalizing. By merging human DNA with that of a shark, I envisioned a species that could dominate the aquatic world. Early trials were promising—subject 004 exhibited increased lung capacity and adaptation to underwater pressure far beyond human capabilities.</p>

        <p>However, by the third week, signs of a deeper transformation began to manifest. The subject's skin thickened into a coarse, grey texture reminiscent of shark hide, and their teeth began to sharpen, resembling the predator’s infamous bite. But it was when we attempted to bring the subject back to land that the true horror became clear—he could no longer breathe in open air.</p>

        <p>His body, now fully dependent on water for oxygen, rejected the atmosphere violently. Gasping for air, he collapsed. In that moment, it became clear that this was no longer a human capable of living between two worlds—he was now a creature of the ocean, forever bound beneath its waves.</p>

        <p class="warning">Worse yet, his mind began to change. Initially cooperative, he grew increasingly aggressive, territorial, much like the shark whose DNA now dominated his body. We tried to communicate, but it was futile. He had lost all human reasoning, driven now by primal instincts. The ocean called to him, and he answered with violence. Containment became impossible. He was no longer a participant in my experiment but a beast intent on ruling the waters.</p>

        <p>The final act came when he escaped into the ocean, tearing through our underwater containment facility with ease. Now, he roams the depths, a predator in both form and mind, unable to return to land, and too dangerous to live among humans.</p>

        <p>Experiment 004 succeeded in its goal but at the cost of humanity. A reminder that once we alter the core of what it means to be human, there may be no way back.</p>
