        <h1>Journal Entry: Experiment 005</h1>
        <h2 class="glow">Project: Time Perception Alteration</h2>

        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To alter human perception of time by injecting fly DNA, allowing the subject to process time at an accelerated rate, potentially enhancing reflexes and cognitive speed.</p>

        <p>Experiment 005 was initiated in 2004 with the hopes of achieving the impossible—accelerating human time perception to superhuman levels. By integrating the DNA of a common fly, whose perception of time vastly surpasses our own, I believed it would unlock unprecedented cognitive and physical abilities. The subject, 005, responded well to the initial injections. His reactions became lightning fast, his awareness of surroundings heightened beyond normal human limits.</p>

        <p>In the beginning, the results were incredible. Tasks that once took seconds were completed in microseconds. To him, the world moved in slow motion, and for a moment, I believed I had discovered the secret to superhuman potential.</p>

        <p>But the success was short-lived. By the second week, the subject reported unbearable stress. His mind was processing the world at such a rapid pace that minutes felt like days to him. His speech slowed to a crawl, as if it took all his effort to communicate with those around him. His eyes constantly darted, trying to keep up with the flood of information bombarding his senses.</p>

        <p class="warning">By the third week, his mental state began to collapse. Time, for him, had become a prison. The smallest moment stretched into eternity. His mind, unable to cope with the relentless onslaught of stimuli, fractured. He would scream, clutching his head, begging for relief as the world crawled by at a snail’s pace. The accelerated time perception had pushed him to the brink of madness.</p>

        <p>In the final days of the experiment, 005 was no longer able to function. He sat motionless, trapped in a state of paralysis, his perception of time stretched so far that any movement, any action, was futile. His consciousness had become lost in the infinite expansion of moments.</p>

        <p>I was forced to end the experiment. The fly’s perception of time, while remarkable, is incompatible with human cognition. The mind can only handle so much before it breaks. What we gained in speed, we lost in sanity.</p>
