        <h1>Journal Entry: Experiment 010</h1>
        <h2 class="glow">Project: Feline Reflex and Night Vision Modification</h2>

        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To imbue humans with feline reflexes and night vision, creating superhuman agility and the ability to function perfectly in low-light environments.</p>

        <p>Experiment 010 began in 2009 with a goal: to grant humans the superior reflexes, agility, and night vision of a cat. Imagine a human who could move like lightning, see in complete darkness, and react faster than any predator. We believed it would revolutionize warfare, security, and beyond.</p>

        <p>The subject, 010-A, responded well to the initial stages of the modification. His reflexes became almost superhuman, dodging projectiles with ease, and his eyesight adapted to pitch-black conditions. He could see as clearly at night as we could during the day. His agility was unparalleled—he moved with a feline grace and speed that was both mesmerizing and terrifying.</p>

        <p>But as with all great power, it came with a price.</p>

        <p class="warning">010-A began to show signs of sensitivity to daylight. His eyes, now fully adapted to darkness, could no longer bear the brightness of even artificial lights. He became irritable, anxious, hiding in shadows during the day, and venturing out only when the lab lights dimmed for the night shift.</p>

        <p>It wasn’t long before the paranoia set in. The subject would lurk in dark corners, staring out from the shadows with wide, glowing eyes, as if constantly on edge. He began to view the rest of the staff as prey, following them silently through the darkened corridors. His movements became erratic, like a predator stalking its next meal.</p>

        <p>The final breakdown came during a blackout. The lab was plunged into darkness, and 010-A—now fully consumed by his feline instincts—seized the opportunity. He lashed out violently, taking down two guards before anyone realized what was happening. His speed was blinding, his attacks precise. We were no longer dealing with a human, but with a predator.</p>

        <p class="warning">The facility descended into chaos. 010-A moved through the shadows, hunting anyone in his path. It was only when the backup generators kicked in, flooding the area with light, that we were able to regain control—but the damage was done. Equipment was destroyed, personnel injured, and the subject had fully succumbed to his predatory instincts.</p>

        <p>Experiment 010 ended in near-disaster. The subject, now a creature of the night, could not return to daylight life. We’ve quarantined him in a lightless chamber, but we know it’s only a matter of time before he escapes. The reflexes, the night vision, the hunt—he lives for it now. And when the lights go out again, we will not be safe.</p>
