        <h1>Journal Entry: Experiment 008</h1>
        <h2 class="glow">Project: Bioelectric Eel Fusion</h2>

        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To create a human capable of generating and controlling electrical currents, using the DNA of an electric eel.</p>

        <p>2007 marked the beginning of Experiment 008. By integrating the bioelectric capabilities of the electric eel, I aimed to create a human who could generate electricity at will—powering devices, incapacitating threats, even becoming a living battery. The possibilities were endless.</p>

        <p>The first stages of the experiment went smoothly. The subject, 008, began to exhibit low levels of bioelectricity. His skin would occasionally spark, and minor electrical pulses could be detected in his hands. But as the experiment progressed, so did the voltage.</p>

        <p>By the second week, 008’s body had become a living conduit for electricity. He could generate shocks strong enough to light a bulb with his bare hands. But control was an issue. The electrical surges were unpredictable, often flaring up at random moments. His skin would glow faintly in the dark, his veins crackling with energy.</p>

        <p>Then came the internal damage. His muscles began to spasm uncontrollably, as if the electricity was attacking his own body. His heart rate became erratic, constantly struggling to keep up with the unnatural currents coursing through his system. His organs, it seemed, were slowly being cooked from the inside out.</p>

        <p class="warning">But the real horror was in his mind. The electrical energy was not only damaging his body but also his brain. He experienced severe headaches, memory loss, and hallucinations. By the third week, he could no longer distinguish reality from the electrical storms raging in his brain. His speech became disjointed, his thoughts scattered. He screamed of seeing things that weren’t there—shadows, sparks, flashes of light—and begged us to turn off the power that wasn’t even on.</p>

        <p>On the final day of the experiment, 008’s body convulsed in a violent seizure, electricity arcing wildly from his limbs, frying the very equipment designed to monitor him. His internal organs were ravaged beyond repair, and his mind was left in shambles. There was nothing left to save—just a shell of a man, destroyed by the very power I had sought to harness.</p>

        <p class="warning">Experiment 008 was not only a failure but a warning. The human body was never meant to generate such raw power, and the mind cannot survive the storm. The experiment claimed its subject, leaving only destruction in its wake. I will never forget the sight of his glowing body, consumed by the energy that was meant to empower him.</p>
