        <h1>Journal Entry: Experiment 015</h1>
        <h2 class="glow">Subject: Induced Schizophrenia</h2>

        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To induce a state of schizophrenia in a human subject by manipulating neurotransmitter levels, specifically dopamine and glutamate, in order to observe the brain’s natural defensive responses to reality distortion.</p>

        <p>On the 14th of June, 2014, the chemical cocktail was introduced to the subject's central nervous system. Initially, the effects were subtle—auditory hallucinations, mild paranoia. But within days, the subject was fully immersed in a world of delusions.</p>

        <p>The subject believed they were being hunted by invisible creatures. Their body reacted with panic and defensive stances, though no threat existed in reality. Their voice trembled as they screamed at phantoms only they could see. My team and I observed from behind the glass, noting every breakdown of their psyche.</p>

        <p>However, unforeseen complications arose. The subject’s perception began to fracture uncontrollably. They could no longer distinguish between my voice and the voices in their head. Every command was met with resistance, every interaction viewed as a threat. Soon, they lost the ability to recognize themselves in the mirror, attacking their reflection in a fit of primal rage.</p>

        <p class="warning">I had pushed too far. The delicate balance of chemicals within the brain collapsed, leaving the subject in a permanent state of psychosis. No amount of sedation could bring them back. In their final moments, they tore at their own skin, trying to free themselves from "something" underneath.</p>

        <p>Though the experiment failed to stabilize the induced schizophrenia, it granted me a profound understanding of how fragile the human mind truly is. But at what cost?</p>
