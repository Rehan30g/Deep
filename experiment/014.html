        <h1>Journal Entry: Experiment 014</h1>
        <h2 class="glow">Subject: Parasitic Mind Control</h2>

        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To create a parasitic organism capable of overriding human motor control while leaving the consciousness intact. A complete takeover of physical faculties, but with full mental awareness—a fusion of horror and innovation.</p>

        <p>On the 3rd of April, 2013, the parasitic agent was introduced into the host body. Subtle at first, it nestled within the brainstem, gradually exerting its influence. At initial stages, the host reported mild discomfort and odd spasms. This was expected. But what came next... was not.</p>

        <p>The host’s body started to act on its own—picking up objects, moving without command—while their consciousness was imprisoned in a helpless state of observation. Their screams for help, their desperate attempts to regain control, were merely witnessed by the parasite, as if it delighted in their torment.</p>

        <p>The breakthrough was thrilling, yet terrifying. But soon, a fatal flaw emerged. As the parasitic organism grew stronger, it began pushing the host’s mind toward insanity. The conflict between body and mind became unbearable, resulting in extreme paranoia and violent outbursts.</p>

        <p class="warning">The experiment spiraled out of control. The subject, unable to control their actions, attempted to destroy their own body—smashing into walls, breaking bones. The parasite refused to relinquish control, dragging the host into a horrifying cycle of self-destruction. I had no choice but to end the experiment prematurely.</p>

        <p>The subject did not survive. But the data... the data was invaluable. The question remains: can we truly control the mind without breaking the soul?</p>
