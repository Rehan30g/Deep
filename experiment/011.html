        <h1>Journal Entry: Experiment 011</h1>
        <h2 class="glow">Subject: Psychological Manipulation and Complete Isolation</h2>

        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To push the limits of human endurance by subjecting the entity to prolonged mental and physical isolation, breaking the will to conform to human norms.</p>

        <p>In the early months of 2010, Experiment 011 was initiated with a single objective: to explore how far the human psyche could be pushed before it shattered completely. The subject, an adult male with no prior psychological issues, was placed in complete isolation. The only stimuli provided were periodic injections of experimental compounds that heightened aggression and suppressed empathy. Days turned into weeks, and the subject’s will to resist was methodically stripped away.</p>

        <p>By the third month, the subject was no longer recognizable as human. Communication had devolved into primal growls, and the instinct for survival had been replaced by an overwhelming desire to destroy. The experiment was deemed a success when the subject began showing signs of irreversible psychological collapse, yet his physical strength had increased by 200% due to genetic modifications introduced early in the testing phase.</p>

        <p>However, what came next was unexpected. On the 96th day, the subject, now referred to as "Entity 011", broke free of the restraints. Security systems failed to contain him, and in a matter of hours, the entity disappeared from the facility.</p>

        <p class="error">The following 10 days were a nightmare. Local reports began surfacing of missing persons, all within a 50-mile radius of the experiment site. Bodies, if they were found, bore evidence of brutal, methodical violence. Most were unrecognizable, reduced to raw, animalistic remains. Signs of struggle suggested that Entity 011 was stalking his victims, manipulating their fear before attacking. The police, baffled, assumed they were dealing with a serial killer. No one suspected the truth.</p>

        <p class="warning">To this day, the whereabouts of Entity 011 remain unknown. All traces of his existence have been scrubbed from official records, and any mention of Experiment 011 has been buried. What cannot be buried, however, are the scars left on the victims’ families and the unrelenting fear that something—someone—is still out there, waiting for the next prey.</p>

        <p>The experiment was terminated on paper, but the consequences live on in the shadows.</p>
